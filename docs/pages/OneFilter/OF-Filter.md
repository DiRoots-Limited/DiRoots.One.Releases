# Filter

The Filter is the first tab of OneFilter, and this tool allows you yo create filter categories and create conditions to refine the filter. Moreover, you can also manage the views and create new one based on filters applied. Let's get started:

1. The first step is to select whether you want to apply filters based on the Whole Model, the Active View or the Current Selection. Select the radio button to choose the view.
