## Find Elements

Create conditions rules to find elements between Levels and Reference Planes. Follow the steps:

1. Select the AND/OR condition from the drop-down list

2. Click Add Rule

3. Select from the Reference level or Reference plane drop-down list

Once you have selected it, define whether you want to find elements above or below the selected level/reference plane and then enter the name of the level/reference plane in the text input. Please note that in some cases the reference plane may not be renamed, so use the Select button to choose the reference plane manually.

4. Repeat the last step by selecting the corresponding reference level/plane to find elements between the two selected situations.
