# Selections

Let's get started: 

1. The first step is to select whether you want to apply filters based on the Whole Model or the Active View. Select the radio button to choose the view.

2. Now, use the checkboxes to select some Selections you have created. When you choose a selection in the first table, the Selected Categories table will show the values stored in the selection and the list of elements in the table on the right.

If you wish, you can deselect the categories you don't want to see.
