# Revision List

The next step after to creating the sheets and assigning the views is to go to the Revision List tab. In this step, you can assign each sheet a revision phase.

## Revisions

If you haven't set up revisions for the current project, click on the Revisions button to manage them first.

After organizing the revisions, you can apply filters by sets to make the work process easier and assign the correct revision to each sheet.

## Import/Export

If you have several sheets, this tool makes editing much easier. Export an Excel file, edit it as you want, then import it into SheetGen and update the revisions. Edit it to the name as you wish, then import it into SheetGen and update the views.
