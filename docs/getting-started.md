### Updater Settings

The following Update Options can be tweaked:
- activate automatic updates.
- check for updates frequency (the default value is 2 days). 
- change the downloads folder.

```yaml
# Pro Tip for Users
By default the automatic updates can't be disabled.
To go around it, you can set up the check for updates frequency to 365 days, for example.
# Keep in mind that it' recommended to keep your apps updated. Plus, we do not provide support for outdated applications.
```

```yaml
# Pro Tip for IT Administrators

To go around it, there's a configuration file that can be tweaked.

# Steps required
- go to %programdata%\DiRoots.ProSheets\Settings

- Search for the line 'CheckFrequency=2' and change the value to 365, for example.
