# Worksets

The FamilyReviser also allows you to manage and create worksets from categories. Letâ€™s start learning more about:

1.	Choose the categories you want to manage by selecting the radio button between Whole Model, Active View or Current Selection.

2.	Open the list of categories to choose which one to assign the workset to. By default, all categories will be selected, but you can choose as many as you like.

3.	Now click on the Manage Workset button, to open the Worksets panel. Manage the current worksets or create new worksets, and save them.

4. The next step is to select the families of the selected categories and select the corresponding workset in the WorkSet column.
