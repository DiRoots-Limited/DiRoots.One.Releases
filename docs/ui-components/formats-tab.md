## DWG Settings

ProSheets uses the Revit engine to export to DWG. All the DWG settings will be read from the DWG export setups created in Revit.

Steps:
1. In Revit UI go to File -> Export -> DWG and create a new DWG/DXF export setup as per your requirements (if you don't know how to create/modify a DWG/DXF setup, read this [article](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/revit/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2019/ENU/Revit-DocumentPresent/files/GUID-E8443B4B-D55B-4630-BEE3-D2D8628CA17B-htm.html))
2. Use the dropdown to switch between the existing DWG setups. If you created the setup with ProSheets opened, you may need to close and reopen it to see the new setup in the list.
