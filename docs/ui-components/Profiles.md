## What's saved in the profile

The following settings are saved in the profiles.
- Naming rules
- Export settings (for PDF, DWG, DGN, DWF, NWC, IFC, and Images)

## Creating Profiles

ProSheets profiles make it easy to save your settings and reuse them later. It is also a handy way for BIM Managers to create standard rules (e.g., filename conventions) and share them across the organization.

Steps:
1. In the window header, click on the plus (+) button next to the profiles list.
2. Name the profile (give it a meaningful name because this is the name that will show up in the profiles list)
3. Choose if you want to create a profile with the default ProSheets settings, with your current settings, or import settings from an existing profile.
4. Click on the "Create" button to create the profile.

Create the profiles in a network location to allow other users to import them.
See the "Importing Profiles" section to teach users how to pull profiles from a network location.
